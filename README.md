# pupilmetrics
Pupil reactivity to brief sounds.

This is a set of experimental code for auditory-evoked PDR measurement which includes the presentation of thirty 500 ms harmonic tones (f0=200 Hz; 30 harmonics) with an inter-sound interval randomised between 6 and 7 seconds. Participants listen passively to the sounds while pupil responses are recorded. The screen display remained static (identical to that in the main experiment) and participants maintained fixation on a centrally presented black cross. This session normally lasts 4 minutes (including calibration).

This session also starts with a 10-second-long resting state recording. It is better to lengthen this part to 15~30 second.

The eyetracker used here is Eyelink 1000 Desktop Mount, SR Research Ltd.
